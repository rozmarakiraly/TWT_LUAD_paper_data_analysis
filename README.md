# Description
 This is a repository that contains the scripts used for downstream data analysis of proteomics and glycoprotemics data from the triple wild-type lung adenocarcinoma project. This repository is not maintained, but feel free to contact the author if you have any questions.

## Details
 For details about data acquisition and processing methods, please read the publication in JPR:
 [Glycoproteomics Analysis of Triple Wild-Type Lung Adenocarcinoma Tissue Samples](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c01063).

## Disclaimer
 The repository also includes data used during / for the review process but is not included in the final manuscript (e.g. validation of glycopeptide identities using FragPipe's glyco-N-HCD search).
